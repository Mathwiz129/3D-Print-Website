    <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Outprint is building a distributed manufacturing network designed to make high-quality 3D printing more accessible and affordable. By connecting customers with a community of reliable, independent makers, we're making it easier to turn digital designs into real-world partsâ€”on-demand and on your terms.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Problem We're Solving</h2>
    <p>Traditional manufacturing is slow, expensive, and centralized. We believe that local, flexible production should be the future. Whether it's a prototype, replacement part, or functional end-use item, customers deserve faster turnaround, better pricing, and direct access to skilled producers. That's what we're here to deliver.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Our Approach</h2>
    <p>We're starting simply-using integrated forms to collect applications and order requests-because we working on creating connections rather than launching with unnecessary complexity before it is even needed. Every feature we build is based on feedback from the people who contribute: the makers and customers using the platform.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Where We're Going</h2>
    <p>As the Outprint network grows, so will the tools behind it. We're planning seamless quote generation, printer matchmaking based on performance and availability, transparent turnaround times, and automatic fulfillment pipelines. </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Who Should Join</h2>
    <p>If you're a 3D printer owner with reliable equipment and a maker's mindset, we want to hear from you. If you're a product designer, hobbyist, startup, engineer, or educator in need of custom parts then you're in the right place. Our system is built to prioritize quality, communication, and trust.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Join the First Wave</h2>
    <p>By joining early, you're not just gaining access to a growing customer base-you're helping shape a platform built for the future of manufacturing.</p>
